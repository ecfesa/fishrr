    """Wow, where am I?

The last thing I remember is that I got a weird, old floppy disk from the  bottom of a lake. Did it bring me here?

How did I get here?
I don't know the exact reason why, but this certainly seems like a tutorialisland of some sorts.

I'm also unsure on how those commands work and why they ran automatically, but I need to get out of here.

From looking at the commands that ran automatically, I can only assume the following:
1- The 'cd' command is used to navigate somewhere.
2- The 'ls' command is used to see what's inside where I'm currently in.
3- For some reason, to think I need to run 'think'.

I need to get out of here this computer dimension. Let me look around and see if I can find any tips.""",
"""I'm not really sure what to do next, but my instincts tell me to fish.

For that, I need my gear. I saw in the beginning that there was a backpack at '/backpack'.
Maybe I should check it out.

I also noticed that there was a few interesting places in this island. It even has a fish pond!"""
